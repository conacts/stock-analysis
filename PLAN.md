# AI Trading System Development Plan

## Current Foundation Status âœ…

### What We Have Working:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: 3 tables (agents, analysis_results, health_checks)
- **Type-Safe Schema**: Minimal, focused database design
- **Environment Management**: `.env.local` with PostgreSQL connection
- **Database Workflow**: `db:push` (dev), `db:migrate` (prod), `db:health`
- **Base Agent Class**: OpenAI Agents SDK integration in `src/agents/base/base-agent.ts`
- **Trigger.dev Integration**: Deployed to staging and production
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline with database deployment
- **Clean Codebase**: 1,104 lines, no placeholder code

---

## Notes & Considerations ðŸ’­

### Development Philosophy Alignment:

- **Types as Foundation**: Every agent function is fully typed
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: No shortcuts, clear agent behavior
- **Iterative Building**: Each agent works before adding complexity
- **Configuration Centralization**: Agent settings in `src/config/`
- **Context Locality**: Agent logic stays together

### Risk Considerations:

- Start with paper trading only
- Implement multiple validation layers
- Add manual approval for significant decisions
- Maintain audit trails for all agent actions

_This plan follows our established philosophy: build a working foundation, then iterate. Each phase should be fully functional before moving to the next._
