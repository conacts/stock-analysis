# Connection with Drizzle:
from drizzle_orm import drizzle
from drizzle_orm.postgres_js import postgres
import os

client = postgres(os.getenv("DATABASE_URL"))
db = drizzle(client)
```

## üöÄ GETTING STARTED

### Immediate Next Steps:

2. **Install Drizzle** - Add ORM and migration tools
3. **Create Schema** - Define PostgreSQL tables
4. **Build Migration** - Create migration runner
5. **Set up Husky** - Add pre-commit hooks

### Questions to Resolve:

-   [ ] Should we use Drizzle Studio for database management?
-   [ ] Do we want connection pooling from day 1?
-   [ ] Should migrations be reversible?
-   [ ] How do we handle migration failures?

**Let's start with the database migration pipeline right now!** üöÄ
